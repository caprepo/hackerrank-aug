Question 1:
============
string compression.
For example: input aaabbcc ouput : a3b2c2

Question 2: 
=============
Given a string s and two words w1 and w2 that are present in S. The task is to find the minimum distance between w1 and w2. Here distance is the number of steps or words between the first and the second word.

Example:
-------------
Input : s = “geeks for geeks contribute practice”, w1 = “geeks”, w2 = “practice”
Output : 1
There is only one word between closest occurrences of w1 and w2.

Input : s = “the quick the brown quick brown the frog”, w1 = “quick”, w2 = “frog”
Output : 2

Question:3
================
Check it power of 10 or not
Input =[1,10,100],  Output = Power of 10
Input = [-2,-4,3] , Output = Not Power of 10

Questions:4
===============
Find the 2nd largest element in the given array.

Question:5
=================
Given a positive number, find out all combinations of positive numbers that adds upto that number. The program should print only combinations, not permutations. For example, for input 3, either 1, 2 or 2, 1 should be printed.

Example:
-------------
Input: N = 3
Output:
1 1 1
1 2
3

Input: N = 5
Output:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2
1 1 3
1 2 2
1 4
2 3
5 


Question:6
===========
They provided one Array {1,2,3,4} and target value as input.So we need to return sum of minimum element required  for targeted value.

Example :
----------
Target Value = 6
out put = 2+4 =6            return 2    element required .

Target Value = 12
output = 1+2+3+4 = 10   return -1  target value out of Scope .

Question:7
=============
A little girl has 5 ten rupee coins, 10 two rupee coins and 50 five rupee coins. The needs 50 rupees out of this. 
Write a program to find all possible ways the girl can make 50 rupees.


Question:8
=============
"Given an unsorted array A of size N, find a continuous sub-array which  sums up to S.

For example if the input array is [ 12,7,29,6, 2, 11,4,8] and the  expected sum is 8, then there are two possibilities [6,2] and [8]
if the expected sum is 19 there are two possibilites [12,7] and [6,2,11].  [11,8] is not a possibility since its not continous.
"

Question:9
==============
Find Reverse String With Preserving Order.

Ex:
  Input = abcd, output = dcba
  Input = I am Java Developer, Output  = r ep olev eDavajamI
  
  Question:10
  =============
 Write a program for Panaram Detector.

The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" contains every single letter in the alphabet. 
Such sentences are called pangrams. Write a function called "findMissingLetters"  which takes a String `sentence`,  
and returns all the letters it is missing. Which prevent it from being a pangram. You should ignore the case of the 
letters in sentence, and your return should be all lower case letters, in alphabetical order.
You should also ignore all non US-ASCII characters.
